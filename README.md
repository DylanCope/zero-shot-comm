# Learning to Communicate with Strangers via Channel Randomisation Methods

This is the source code for our paper ["Learning to Communicate with Strangers via Channel Randomisation Methods" (Cope and Shoots, 2020)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FaBSE8jcuf6hGIbbp34Dxu7jPjh0iJl0/view) presented at the [4th NeurIPS Workshop on Emergent Communication](https://sites.google.com/view/emecom2020).

## Installation

There are two ways of installing and running this codebase. 

* One way is to use the `environment.yml` to recreate the conda environment.

* Another way is to create a Docker container using the provided Dockerfile and scripts. The image inherits from `tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter`. If you do not have gpu access then you will need to adapt the Dockerfile and change the run script (remove the `--runtime nvidia` parameter).

## Repository Structure

* notebooks: this folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks that contain our experiments.
* zscomm: this is a Python package written to house the core code for our project.
* experiments: this contains all the data produced during our experiments: i.e. network weights and train/test metrics.
* figures: figures generated by our experiments
